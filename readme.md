# replit-desktop

Could not find one on github so I quickly made my own (using electron). You should have npm and nodejs installed along with the npm electron package.

### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/TheOfficialPeter/replit-desktop
```

### jump into root directory
```
cd replit-desktop
```

### install the electron package
```
npm i electron
```

### run the code
```
npm start
```
